# MinusOne Music

**MinusOne Cloud Music** (减一云音乐, app name: *MinusOne Music*) is a lightweight, third-party NetEase Cloud Music (NCM) client for Android, currently in an inactive (though not abandoned) state of early development.

This project was started as a foundational learning experience, and its current codebase is a candid reflection of the developer's skills and architectural understanding at the time.

To align the project with current best practices and showcase significant skill progression, a full migration to **Jetpack Compose** is planned. This strategic refactor will not only modernize the application with a declarative UI but also serve as a practical demonstration of developer growth.

## Misc.

<details>
<summary>Misc.</summary>
<p>
- **On the project's name:** The project was initially named 'NaCl,' derived from the letters in the official NCM app's name. This was intended to signify its role as a "lite" alternative, reflecting both the developer's technical limitations and the intentional omission of non-essential features. However, the name was changed to avoid confusion with 'Salt Music,' another existing music app. The current name, MinusOne Cloud Music, was chosen to align with both the official NCM app's '-1' slogan and its naming format.
</p>
<p>
- **On security and cryptography:** The project includes a very basic NDK implementation. While arguably redundant for an application of this scale, it was incorporated primarily as a valuable learning exercise.
